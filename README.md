punjabi-segmenter
=================

Given an unspaced sentence in "Punjabi", segment it into words using some minor modifications of Peter Norvig's code.
A very minor modification in it will make it work for almost any Indian language like Hindi, Telugu, Sanskrit, Bangla etc.
The word corpus used is a filtered version of the one taken from: http://corpora.heliohost.org/ 

I will update the Readme later with the walkthrough of the code! Email me if required.
